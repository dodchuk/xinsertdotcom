I indexed it as “00” because it’s the perfect way to keep things in order and, you know, start fresh, ensuring everything is in its place from the very beginning.</p><p>This model is a representation of a character’s lifestyle, reflected through their choice of clothing and accessories. All these little details become part of their identity. The idea didn’t come to me by chance. I’ve always loved speed, and at the same time, I feel a deep connection to street culture and hip-hop, which has always been my way of expressing myself. Pixel art style, for me, is a return to the roots. I grew up playing video games with pixel graphics, and for me, it’s not just a style. It’s a part of the cultural and technological history that carries the vibe of the old school.</p>"
